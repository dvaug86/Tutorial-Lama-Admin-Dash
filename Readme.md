This is the second part of creating a netflix clone. 

I am following  several tutorials in the process of learning all I can to create a complex checklist app for books, movies and tv shows
I'm creating this repository in order to learn more about the application of apis.
This netflix clone is hopefully the last part before I set off on my own to create this checklist.

You can see my checklist clone I made from Ania's tutorial in my repository.
